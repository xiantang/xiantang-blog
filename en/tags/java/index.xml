      <description>Generally speaking, equals() and &amp;quot;==&amp;quot; operator are used to compare whether two objects are equal, but there are many differences between the two:
 The main difference is that .equals() is a method, == is an operator. Use == to compare references, referring to whether they point to the same memory address.

      <description>Collection Expansion ArrayList The default capacity of ArrayList is 10, so if you need to handle large amounts of data with ArrayList, you need to use the method of explicitly specifying the capacity. This can reduce unnecessary expansion operations. The main reason is that the expansion operation of ArrayList requires extra space, and it uses the Arrays.copyOf method for copying: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</description>
