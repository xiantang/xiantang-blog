      <description>Today is the first day of 2023, I want to write a year-end summary, to review some things in 2022. It is also a review of myself.
Year-end Summary of 2022 2022 was not a very smooth year, it seems that everyone is not doing particularly well due to the economic downturn.
Work I have been working in Singapore for more than a year and a half. Because Singapore does not have four seasons, every day is actually similar to the previous one.</description>

      <description>This article will not tell you how to configure neovim step by step, but will tell you some &amp;ldquo;Tao&amp;rdquo; about PDE, not the specific practice of &amp;ldquo;Art&amp;rdquo;.
Introduction to neovim and PDE Seeing TJ&amp;rsquo;s YouTube introduced the use of neovim as a PDE, it was interesting, so I tried it myself, it felt good, so I recorded it.
What is neovim Neovim is a branch of vim, vim is a text editor, neovim is a branch of vim, its goal is to provide a better vim, not a substitute for vim.</description>

      <description>If a sequence of three commands is executed twice in a row, it is recommended that you write it as a Shell script &amp;ndash; blog.fleeto.us
 Recently, I increasingly realize that shell can replace python as the second language for devops engineers.
Because daily work may be repetitive, many repetitive operations in work can be reduced by shell scripts to reduce mental burden.
Let me give you an example:</description>

      <description>Docker is not a new technology, but a tool that puts old wine in new bottles.
 Actually, I used Docker when I was in college, around 2017, when Docker was in its heyday. It was just used to start various lightweight applications, such as magnetic link downloaders, personal network disks, etc. Until recently, my understanding of Docker was still relatively vague. As I continued to encounter requirements at work, I also continued to understand Docker, so I decided to write an article to summarize my recent use of Docker.</description>

      <description>Some Practices and Thoughts on Writing Maintainable Code Recently, I have been modifying a piece of historical code that has a distinct style and has been handled by many hands. I found that there are many mistakes in the design of the code. This makes it very difficult for me to modify the code and add new features. This article is written with personal emotions, so there may be some subjectivity.</description>

      <description>The value of a person lies in finding connections between memorized information.
 I previously recommended bidirectional link software to my friends for rote memorization, and many people asked me &amp;ldquo;Why use bidirectional links? What are the benefits?&amp;rdquo;. I will write a short article here to answer these questions.
I have tried many note-taking software before, such as Notion, Evernote, and even Typora managed directly with git. Most of the time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the motivation to take notes.</description>

      <description>Procrastination always allows us to live in peace, but the problem does not disappear. &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Pomodoro Technique Illustrated&amp;rdquo;
 Current Issues Stress causes anxiety, there is always a lot of pressure in Internet companies, some come from overly high OKRs, some come from colleagues&#39; push, and even you will put a lot of pressure on yourself. For me, it might be all of these, and possibly the pressure given by the morning meeting and weekly report.</description>

      <description>The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction. Go Proverbs
 Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the conclusion. If your Golang interface has too many functions that make it difficult for you to expand horizontally, then split it into multiple interfaces according to its responsibilities, and then use embed to combine them.
Problem Encountered Recently, when refactoring a component that manages configurations, we have an interface and more than 5 structs implement this interface.</description>

      <description>For me, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to fall into a state of working all day, being busy all day but not knowing what I&amp;rsquo;m busy with, leading to anxiety the next day, not knowing what to say at the morning meeting, and only being able to do things that make me feel like I can talk.
 Why introduce the Pomodoro Technique: To solve this problem, I thought of many methods, such as writing a TODO list every day, but I still wasted a lot of time due to various interruptions, which made it impossible for me to complete the tasks in my original TODO list.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was maintaining an open source project called air on the weekend. It is a hot loading code tool for Golang, which will monitor local file changes and then automatically reload.
 Problem encountered Recently, I encountered a particularly interesting problem, that is, when using the kill -9 pid command to kill the process, although it will kill its child process, its grandchild process will still survive.
Background In short, our hot loading component will run commands, and then will monitor file changes, once the file changes, it will kill the previous process, then recompile the code, and then execute the running command.</description>

      <description>Make the zero value useful. &amp;ndash;Go Proverbs
 Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the Golang blog: The zero value
 When memory is allocated to store a value, whether by declaration or by calling make or new, and no explicit initialization is provided, the memory is given a default initialization. Each element of this value is set to its type&amp;rsquo;s zero value: false for booleans, 0 for integers, 0.0 for floats, &amp;quot;&amp;quot; for strings, and nil for pointers, functions, interfaces, slices, channels, and maps.</description>

      <description>Some Details About Golang Slice In Golang, there are two types of data: One is an array with a fixed length, called Array, and the other is an array with an unlimited length, called Slice. Distinguish Between Array and Slice The difference between Array and Slice is: Array is of fixed length, and the length of Array is part of the type, so the length of Array cannot be changed,</description>

      <description>Commonly Used Principles in Computing When writing code, we often have some insights and experiences. These experiences have long been summarized into principles by the predecessors. In the past year, I have been collecting various principles and constantly applying and practicing them.
KISS Principle The KISS Principle is an acronym for Keep It Simple, Stupid.
The KISS principle refers to the principle that simplicity should be emphasized in design. Summarizing the experience of engineering professionals in the design process, most system designs should remain simple and pure, without incorporating unnecessary complexity, so that the system can operate optimally.</description>

      <description>Background I feel that there are still many deficiencies in my English, so I studied some English grammar a while ago. In fact, many of them are things that need to be learned in junior high school, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t take it seriously at that time, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn anything from the teacher. I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I gave everything back to the teacher, because the scenarios where English is needed in work are increasing, so I still followed Youtube and learned a lot, so I wrote this summary article.</description>

      <description>What is the Token Bucket Algorithm? The token bucket algorithm is a rate limiting algorithm, which is the opposite implementation of the leaky bucket algorithm.
The leaky bucket algorithm leaks at a certain frequency rate, and our requests can be imagined as the faucet above.
The token bucket algorithm, on the other hand, periodically puts tokens into the bucket, and each request will get a token from the token bucket. If there are no tokens in the bucket, the request is rejected or blocked until a token can be obtained.</description>

      <description>What is AtomicInteger As the name suggests, AtomicInteger is an Integer with atomic operations. The difference between AtomicInteger and a regular Integer is that AtomicInteger uses a CAS method to make Integer&amp;rsquo;s increment and other operations atomic. Knowledge needed before implementation First, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the increment operation of AtomicInteger: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 public final int incrementAndGet() { for (;;) { int current = get();</description>

      <description>What is Minor GC/Major GC First, let&amp;rsquo;s popularize the classic heap layout of JVM:
For the classic JVM heap layout, there are two clear areas, the first is the Young area, which generally stores young objects or objects that have just been created. The second is the Old area, also known as the old generation, which generally stores longer-lived objects or objects promoted from the young area.
For the young area, we have three areas, one is the Eden area, and the other two are Survivor areas of equal size.</description>

      <description>What is GC Root First of all, we know the marking algorithm, the JVM&amp;rsquo;s marking algorithm can be understood as a reachability algorithm, so all reachability algorithms will have a starting point, and this starting point is the GC Root.
That is, it is necessary to find all living objects through the GC Root, and then all the remaining unmarked objects are the objects to be recycled.
Characteristics of GC Root  Objects that are alive at the current moment!</description>

      <description>What is the Leaky Bucket Algorithm? As the name suggests, the Leaky Bucket algorithm uses a leaky bucket to limit traffic. Because there is a hole at the bottom of the bucket, it will leak water at regular intervals, and we can imagine the traffic as water falling into the bucket from above. This leads to two situations. If the speed at which traffic is injected into the bucket is</description>

      <description>What is the Singleton Pattern? The Singleton Pattern, also known as the Singleton, is a commonly used software design pattern and is one of the creational patterns. In this design pattern, the class of the singleton object must ensure that only one instance exists. Pros and Cons Pros: There is only one instance in memory, reducing memory overhead. Cons: It violates the Single Responsibility Principle, and there is no interface,</description>

      <description>What is TCP  TCP is a full-duplex, byte-stream protocol based on the IP protocol. TCP provides end-to-end accurate transmission.  Acknowledges each byte Handles poor network conditions  Timeout retransmission Congestion control   Efficiency improvement  Uses sliding window protocol     TCP is a connection-oriented protocol.  Since it is connection-oriented, how is this connection established?
That is, the following question is how to establish a virtual link using a three-way handshake.</description>

      <title>How Actor Handles Blocking Messages</title>

      <description>I noticed in the business code that a lot of
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
is used as the thread pool for executing Future inside the Actor. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think there was a problem before. But after reading the akka source code, it seems a bit inappropriate.
Let&amp;rsquo;s briefly talk about the architecture of Actor
When an Actor sends a message to another Actor, it sends this message to the recipient&amp;rsquo;s mailbox
The mailbox is a class that implements Runnable, so it can be executed by a thread pool.</description>

      <description>Background: When I first came to a company with Scala as its technology stack, I spent a long time setting up the environment. After finally getting the project up and running, I found the code inside to be very strange. There were no loops, and data operations were a function nested within another function. This was very puzzling. So, driven by business needs and curiosity, I began to learn about Scala.</description>

      <title>AES Requires Limiting SEED Length</title>
      <link>https://vim0.com/en/post/scala/aes_limit_length/</link>

      <description>I wrote a utility class to encrypt and decrypt the app field in the database
There are no problems running unit tests in the local environment, but bugs appear in the production environment.
The reason for this is that the online environment does not support the AES algorithm Provider. It needs to be solved by adding a third-party package that supports it under the ext package or introducing a third-party library.</description>

      <title>How to distinguish between == and .equals() method in Java</title>
      <link>https://vim0.com/en/post/translate/java_equals/</link>

      <guid>https://vim0.com/en/post/translate/java_equals/</guid>
      <description>Generally speaking, equals() and &amp;quot;==&amp;quot; operator are used to compare whether two objects are equal, but there are many differences between the two:
 The main difference is that .equals() is a method, == is an operator. Use == to compare references, referring to whether they point to the same memory address. Use .equals() to compare the content of objects, comparing values. If .equals is not overridden, it will default to calling the nearest superclass to override this method.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the year, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to write a little summary of 2018.
This year, there have been losses and gains. The loss was the failure of a relationship that didn&amp;rsquo;t work out, and the gain was a general improvement in my personal quality.
Let&amp;rsquo;s not dwell on what&amp;rsquo;s lost.
Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the gains.
The gains can be divided into three aspects: physical, technical, and financial.</description>

      <title>Java Collection Expansion</title>

      <description>Collection Expansion ArrayList The default capacity of ArrayList is 10, so if you need to handle large amounts of data with ArrayList, you need to use the method of explicitly specifying the capacity. This can reduce unnecessary expansion operations. The main reason is that the expansion operation of ArrayList requires extra space, and it uses the Arrays.copyOf method for copying: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</description>
