      <title>How Actor Handles Blocking Messages</title>

      <description>I noticed in the business code that a lot of
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
is used as the thread pool for executing Future inside the Actor. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think there was a problem before. But after reading the akka source code, it seems a bit inappropriate.
Let&amp;rsquo;s briefly talk about the architecture of Actor
When an Actor sends a message to another Actor, it sends this message to the recipient&amp;rsquo;s mailbox
The mailbox is a class that implements Runnable, so it can be executed by a thread pool.</description>

      <title>How to learn Scala</title>

      <description>Background: When I first came to a company with Scala as its technology stack, I spent a long time setting up the environment. After finally getting the project up and running, I found the code inside to be very strange. There were no loops, and data operations were a function nested within another function. This was very puzzling. So, driven by business needs and curiosity, I began to learn about Scala.</description>

      <title>AES Requires Limiting SEED Length</title>
      <link>https://vim0.com/en/post/scala/aes_limit_length/</link>

      <description>I wrote a utility class to encrypt and decrypt the app field in the database
There are no problems running unit tests in the local environment, but bugs appear in the production environment.
The reason for this is that the online environment does not support the AES algorithm Provider. It needs to be solved by adding a third-party package that supports it under the ext package or introducing a third-party library.</description>
